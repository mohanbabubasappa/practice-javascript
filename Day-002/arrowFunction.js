// arrowFunction is a concise way to write functions in JavaScript
// It uses the arrow syntax (=>) and does not have its own 'this' context
// Arrow functions are often used for short functions or callbacks
// They can be assigned to a variable or used directly in expressions

var getDetails=()=>{
    console.log("This is an arrow function");
}

getDetails();
